  "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning that focuses on how an intelligent agent should act in a dynamic environment to maximize a reward signal. It is one of the three basic machine learning paradigms, along with supervised and unsupervised learning. RL differs from supervised learning as it does not require labelled input-output pairs or explicit correction of sub-optimal actions. Instead, it seeks a balance between exploration and exploitation to maximize cumulative reward. The environment in RL is typically expressed as a Markov decision process (MDP), and many RL algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. RL is studied in various disciplines due to its generality."
