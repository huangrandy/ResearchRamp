    "project_title": "Context-Aware Neural Models for Conversational AI",
    "description": "Building a conversational AI system that leverages context-aware neural models to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. The system will integrate transformer-based architectures with memory mechanisms to maintain conversation history and adapt to user intents. The project focuses on improving the naturalness and accuracy of conversational agents.\n\nThe system will need to:\n1. Process and encode conversation history using memory-enhanced neural networks\n2. Generate contextually relevant responses using transformer-based models\n3. Adapt to user intents and preferences dynamically\n4. Handle ambiguous or incomplete user inputs gracefully\n\nThe initial implementation will target customer support chatbots, with the goal of expanding to virtual personal assistants."
