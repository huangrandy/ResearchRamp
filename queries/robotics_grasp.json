    "project_title": "Learning to Grasp: A Self-Improving Robotic System for Adaptive Object Manipulation",
    "description": "Developing a robotic system that can learn to manipulate objects in unstructured environments. The system will use reinforcement learning to acquire manipulation skills through trial and error, with the goal of generalizing to novel objects and situations. The project involves developing both the learning algorithms and the robotic control infrastructure.\n\nThe system will need to:\n1. Process visual input to identify objects\n2. Plan appropriate grasping strategies\n3. Execute manipulation tasks\n4. Learn from successful and failed attempts\n\nThe initial implementation will focus on pick-and-place tasks with common household objects, with the goal of expanding to more complex manipulation sequences."
