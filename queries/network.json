    "project_title": "Self-Optimizing Software-Defined Networks for Edge Computing",
    "description": "Developing a software-defined networking (SDN) system that dynamically optimizes data flow for edge computing environments. The system will use reinforcement learning to adapt routing policies and resource allocation based on real-time network conditions and application demands. The project aims to enhance performance and reliability in edge networks.\n\nThe system will need to:\n1. Monitor network traffic and resource utilization in real-time\n2. Optimize routing policies using reinforcement learning algorithms\n3. Adapt to changing network conditions and application requirements\n4. Ensure low latency and high throughput for edge applications\n\nThe initial implementation will focus on IoT (Internet of Things) networks, with the goal of scaling to larger edge computing infrastructures."
