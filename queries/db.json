    "project_title": "Adaptive Query Optimization for Distributed Databases",
    "description": "Developing a distributed database system that can adaptively optimize query execution plans in real-time. The system will leverage machine learning techniques to predict optimal query plans based on workload patterns and system performance metrics. The project aims to improve query execution efficiency in dynamic and heterogeneous environments.\n\nThe system will need to:\n1. Monitor query workloads and system performance metrics\n2. Predict optimal query execution plans using machine learning models\n3. Adapt query plans dynamically based on changing workloads\n4. Ensure fault tolerance and consistency across distributed nodes\n\nThe initial implementation will focus on OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) workloads, with the goal of extending to OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) scenarios."
