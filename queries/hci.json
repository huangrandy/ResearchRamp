    "project_title": "Personalized Multimodal Interfaces for Assistive Technologies",
    "description": "Designing a multimodal interface system that adapts to individual user needs for assistive technologies. The system will integrate speech, gesture, and eye-tracking inputs to provide seamless interaction for users with physical or cognitive impairments. The project focuses on creating a personalized and inclusive user experience.\n\nThe system will need to:\n1. Process and integrate multimodal inputs (speech, gestures, eye-tracking)\n2. Adapt the interface dynamically based on user preferences and behavior\n3. Provide real-time feedback and error correction\n4. Ensure accessibility and usability for diverse user groups\n\nThe initial implementation will target assistive communication devices, with the goal of expanding to smart home control systems."
