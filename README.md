   - Hover over nodes for quick information
   - Click nodes for detailed view

3. **Seminal Work Detection**
   - Select "Seminal Analysis" from the menu
   - Choose a research area or paper
   - View the analysis results
   - Explore related papers

### Common Operations

1. **Adding New Papers**
```bash
# Using the command line
python src/utils/paper_utils.py add --paper_id "your_paper_id"

# Or through the web interface
# Navigate to "Add Paper" section
```

2. **Updating the Network**
```bash
# Refresh the visualization
python src/utils/graph_utils.py update

# Or use the "Refresh" button in the interface
```

3. **Exporting Results**
   - Use the "Export" button in the interface
   - Choose format (JSON, CSV, or PNG)
   - Select the data to export

### Troubleshooting

1. **Server Issues**
   - Check if the port 5000 is available
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Check the logs in `logs/app.log`

2. **Visualization Problems**
